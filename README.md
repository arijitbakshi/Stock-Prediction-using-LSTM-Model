 # Tesla Stock Prediction using LSTM ML Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Tesla's stock prices using a machine learning model based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in Tesla's stock performance.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Historical Tesla stock price data will be collected, along with relevant market indicators and news sentiment data. The data will be preprocessed by normalizing, scaling, and structuring it into appropriate sequences.

2. **LSTM Model Development:** An LSTM neural network will be designed and implemented using Python and suitable libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model will be configured to take sequences of past stock prices as input and predict future prices.

3. **Training and Validation:** The model will be trained on a portion of the dataset and validated on another portion to prevent overfitting. Techniques like early stopping and cross-validation will be employed to optimize the model's performance.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation:** The trained LSTM model will be used to predict Tesla's stock prices on unseen data. The predictions will be evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure its accuracy.

5. **Visualization:** Visualizations will be created to compare the model's predictions with actual stock prices over time. This will provide insights into the model's performance in capturing market trends.

6. **Future Applications:** The potential real-world applications of the LSTM model for Tesla stock prediction will be discussed, including its use in investment decision support and risk management.
